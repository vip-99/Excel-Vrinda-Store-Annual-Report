Project : Vrinda store anual report (https://github.com/vip-99/Vrinda-Store-Annual-Report/blob/main/Vrinda%20Store%20Annual%20Report.pdf)



 The objective of this project is to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Vrinda store can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023. 



Analysis:
First, I understood the data in the data sets and found the business problems.
I did data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values and made an Age group column from the Age column using the IF function.
Created a Pivot table to summarize the data and create charts and graphs to solve business problems.
At Last, I have built a dashboard in Excel with slicers so that users can interact with the dashboard and view it in different ways to get results.
